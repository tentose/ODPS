# ODPS
Optical DPS meter for Guild Wars 2

# Why?
Unlike other popular DPS meters (ArcDPS). ODPS measures DPS without having to inject Dll into the GW2 process. 

## Benefits
- No need to inject Dll into GW2.exe

## Drawbacks
- Less accurate
- More resources used
- Less detail

# Usage
1. Ensure GW2's chat window is open. Turn on the Chat Panel (default Ctrl + \\) to ensure the chat window has a solid(ish) background.
2. Turn on combat logs
3. Change chat text size to "Large" in the Gears menu by the chat window
4. Run ODPS
